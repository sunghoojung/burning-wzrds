# burning-wzrds

The nft project Wzrds released a new mechanism which allowed stakers to burn listed wzrds. However as time went on it became harder and harder to burn the Wzrds on the site as only 1 was listed every few minutes. This script monitors when a burnable wzrd is shown upon the website and will interact with a smart contract to burn the wzrd.

NOTE: after every time you submit a transaction you have to restart script. Also to put in your private key, public addy, rpc, and the gas you want to use you have to input it into the js file I couldn't get the env file working :( New script now just sends the tx without checking if it will revert or not. 

Any issues please add me on discord sunny#7654 or follow me on twitter and ask me there @pogendpoint.
